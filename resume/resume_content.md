## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

### Information Systems Engineer - Private Cloud Infrastructure Services
**TIAA, Charlotte NC**
June 2025 - Present

**VCF9 Automation Research & Development:**
- Conducting in-depth research and hands-on exploration of VMware Cloud Foundation 9 (VCF9) infrastructure stack in preparation for potential enterprise-wide upgrade from current vRA/vRO 8.x architecture.
- Evaluating VCF9 automation capabilities, deployment models, and integration patterns to inform strategic upgrade planning and ensure seamless transition path for existing automation workflows.

**Security & Integration Standardization:**
- Architected and implemented environment-specific service account strategy across entire VMware Aria Automation stack (vRA, vRO, vIDM, vRSLCM) spanning 13 environments, decoupling shared credentials model to enable independent credential rotation for enhanced security posture.
- Conducted comprehensive audit of heavily customized environments to identify all service account touchpoints across external integrations including vCenter, Git, Infoblox IPAM, and inter-environment connections.
- Standardized service account reference patterns and authentication mechanisms across all automation stack components through meticulous research, documentation, and tracking of individual configuration variations.
- Orchestrated seamless migration to isolated service account model with zero production disruption, ensuring continuous availability of critical automation services.

**Enterprise Infrastructure Modernization:**
- Led enterprise-wide VMware Aria Automation stack upgrade across 13 development and production environments, upgrading vRA with embedded vRO from 8.16 to 8.18.1 and vRSLCM from 8.14/8.16 to 8.18.
- Developed and standardized comprehensive upgrade process through extensive testing to ensure zero disruption to production services in single-node deployments without high availability.
- Managed complex upgrade of heavily customized vRA-vRO embedded environment, thoroughly vetting all changes to maintain service continuity and applying security patches to vIDM.
- Executed flawless production upgrades with minimal impact by composing detailed procedures specifically designed for non-HA single-node architecture.

**Crossfunctional Initiatives:**
- Expanding TA Hub into a monorepo architecture to support additional rotational programs as dedicated profile hubs, redesigning application structure for modularity and configurability while maintaining code reusability across program-specific implementations.
- Continuing to design and create event graphics in Figma for Alliance BRG, promoting LGBTQ+ inclusivity and visibility across the organization.
